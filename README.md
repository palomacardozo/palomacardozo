Hi, I’m @palomacardozo

I’m interested in web/IOS development, cybersecurity, and general software engineering.

I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the Georgia Instuite of Technology

My major concentrations are cybersecurity and media/UI, and I am a third year student.

To view my work on my current projects see my two other repositories: https://github.com/palomacardozo/VIP-Machine-Learning-Fall-2024 (Machine Learning Project) and https://github.com/palomacardozo/CS2340 (Full-Stack Web Application for Finding Local Restaurants).
