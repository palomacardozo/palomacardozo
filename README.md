Hi, I’m @palomacardozo

I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the Georgia Instuite of Technology. I’m a fourth-year student and interested in both web development and cybersecurity.

To view my work on my current projects see my two other repositories: https://github.com/palomacardozo/VIP-Machine-Learning-Fall-2024 (Machine Learning Project) and https://github.com/palomacardozo/CS2340 (Full-Stack Web Application for Finding Local Restaurants using Google API). You can also check out my work on a different full-stack web application, used to created Spotify Wrapped interafacing the Spotify API: https://github.com/anushak016/SpotifyWrapped. This application is also hosted remotely at https://spotify-wrapped-app.onrender.com/
