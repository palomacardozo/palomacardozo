Hi, I’m @palomacardozo

I’m interested in web/IOS development, cybersecurity, and general software engineering.

I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the Georgia Instuite of Technology

My major concentrations are cybersecurity and media/UI, and I am a third year student.
